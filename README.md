AmazingWebsite is a project created via [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish), a static site generator for Swift developers, by [John Sundell](https://swiftbysundell.com/), this is us allows you to generate JavaScript-free websites with just HTML and CSS from Markdown files. Publish uses [Ink](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink), a Markdown parser written in Swift and [Plot](https://github.com/johnsundell/plot), a domain specific language (DSL) to write type-independent HTML, XML, and RSS in Swift, which was recently updated to create HTML components in a more SwiftUI-like way.
